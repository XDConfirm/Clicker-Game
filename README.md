### Day 1 _2/21/2022_
hey, i just wanted to make this so people could possibly see my journey through this. i dont know if that made sense but im sure you know what i meant. hopefully. but yknow, i definitely sacrificed my sleep & homework to get v1.4 out. since i literally started from scratch and built the game up. but im trying here. i have a lot of assignments for school that i still havent done, but yet here i am still coding. at this point, it is what it is.
