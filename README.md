## Incremental v2.0.0
As in v2.0.0, the point of this game is to just click! The amount of clicks you have / get is your currency.
With that, you can buy upgrades while getting achievements!

## Running Requirements
You only need a browser that can run HTML5, CSS3, & JS ES6. In short, just make sure that your browser can run the main web languages.
