### i havent touched this project in a very long time, and any time i try making an update, i end up giving up because im not the best when it comes to css & overall styling with ui. this might be updated in the future but since im still a kid, i have no guarantees that ill take up web making as a career as im just becoming a freshman in highschool. this may simply be a hobbie, although not much of a consistent one.

**_So, i'll be honest. the versioning is most likely really bad. please excuse it. i'm a rookie when it comes to stuff like this, especially with github._**
**_the struggle is very real :(_**
