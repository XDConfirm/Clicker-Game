## Incremental v1.4
As in v1.4, the point of this game is to just click! The amount of clicks you have / get is your currency.
With that, you can buy upgrades while getting achievements!

## Requirements
All you really need is a device or browser that can run Javascript. If the javascript isn't working, make sure that you don't have Javascript disabled from the Developer Console.
I also recommend using a device that is about 200x450 resolution. But I don't think most modern machines are that small in native resolution.
